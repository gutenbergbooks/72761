    The cover image was provided by the transcriber and is placed in the public domain.</p>
  <p>
    The original text displayed the Authorized Version of Scripture on the left page and the author’s paraphrase on the facing right page. For the electronic formats, these two versions for each verse have been placed in two columns followed immediately by the corresponding commentary.</p>
  <p>
    Punctuation has been standardized.</p>
  <p>
    Most of the non-common abbreviations used to save space in printing have been expanded to the non-abbreviated form for easier reading.</p>
  <p class="x-ebookmaker-drop">
    Most common abbreviations have been expanded in tool-tips for screen-readers and may be seen by hovering the mouse over the abbreviation.</p>
  <p>
    The text may show quotations within quotations, all set off by similar quote marks. The inner quotations have been changed to alternate quote marks for improved readability.</p>
  <p>
    This book has illustrated drop-caps at the start of each chapter. These illustrations may adversely affect the pronunciation of the word with screen-readers or not display properly in some handheld devices.</p>
  <p>
    This book was written in a period when many words had not become standardized in their spelling. Words may have multiple spelling variations or inconsistent hyphenation in the text. These have been left unchanged unless indicated with a Transcriber’s Note.</p>
  <p>
    Index references have not been checked for accuracy.</p>
  <p>
    The symbol ‘‡’ indicates the description in parenthesis has been added to an illustration. This may be needed if there is no caption or if the caption does not describe the image adequately.</p>
  <p>
    Footnotes are identified in the text with a superscript number and are shown immediately below the paragraph in which they appear.</p>
  <p>
    Transcriber’s Notes are used when making corrections to the text or to provide additional information for the modern reader. These notes are identified by ♦♠♥♣ symbols in the text and are shown immediately below the paragraph in which they appear.</p>

    PREFACE.</h2>
  <p class="chaphdbrk in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HE following Commentary differs from many of its predecessors in the greater weight given to the interpretation of the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>,
    and the closer investigation of their peculiar renderings. In many cases these strange renderings on the part of the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    are dismissed by commentators as simply errors. But this is not consistent with what true criticism ought to do. The <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    is not only the oldest translation we have, but also the only one made when Hebrew was yet a living language. Its peculiar renderings then deserve our most serious attention. The investigation of them will fully reward the inquirer. This, then, is the cause of the special line of interpretation adopted in this Commentary.</p>
  <p>
    With regard to the Book of Ecclesiastes itself, the writer must confess himself <i
      lang="la">homo unius libri</i>;
    for some years past all his Hebrew and Greek studies have been devoted to the investigation of the meaning of this one book in the Sacred Canon, and all his conclusions must be taken with the reservation that they apply, directly, to this one book alone. Such a concentration of effort may be expected to produce results which might not be arrived at by a far wider and more extensive research, just as a few rays of sunlight concentrated by a small lens will burn where the sun himself will only warm.</p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless, this book does not profess to be anything in the nature of a new discovery. Sense is attempted to be made of difficult passages by what may be called a microscopic attention to the grammar of the writer, and a minute and careful analysis of every form and expression he uses. The test of the correctness of the meaning thus found is displayed in the way in which it falls into place in the
    <a id="a008"></a>context, and squares with its tenor. But nothing novel in the way of Hebrew grammar is urged, or anything which may not be found in ordinary commentaries, except, perhaps, it be the fact of the difference of signification between the contracted and full relative pronoun――a usage which is peculiar to the Book of Ecclesiastes. This has hitherto been dismissed by other commentators as evidence of late composition, without giving it the notice it merited.</p>
  <p>
    Many points of interest are started in these pages, which would well repay a more careful investigation than I have either leisure or learning to follow out. They are only presented so far as necessary to illustrate and clear up difficulties in the interpretation of that marvellous book which is the subject of this Commentary. If I have succeeded, the Church will be benefited; if I have altogether failed, my book will only add a few pages more to the vast literature which this, the scientific treatise of the Divine Word, has elicited.</p>

    INTRODUCTION.</h2>
  <p class="sectbrk align_ctr smcap_all">
    DATE AND AUTHORSHIP.</p>
  <p class="secthdbrk in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HE title or superscription of the book is, chapter <abbr
      title="1">i.</abbr> 1,
    ‘The words of Koheleth, the son of David, king of Jerusalem,’ and this is further explained in verse 12, by ‘I Koheleth was king over Israel in Jerusalem.’ The only person in Jewish history who answers exactly to this description is Solomon, and accordingly the whole ancient Church, Jewish as well as Christian, have regarded Solomon as the undoubted author of the book. With this conclusion even modern criticism is so far agreed, that it is universally admitted that Solomon is the hero or personated author, even though it is denied that he was the real writer. It is alleged that internal evidence is against the supposition of so early a date; for that the language and tone of thought in the book point to a writer further on in Jewish history. The favourite opinion amongst German scholars is, that Ecclesiastes was composed towards the end of the Persian dominion. Ewald, indeed, considers that, so far as language and style is concerned, the book might be the very latest written in the whole Hebrew Scriptures.</p>
  <p>
    A detailed history of the exposition of the book will be found in the <i>Coheleth</i> of <abbr
      title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Ginsburg,
    together with a complete discussion of the reasons for and against Solomonic authorship. It will be unnecessary, therefore, to go into detail on this point. We shall only add what concerns the immediate object of the present Commentary, remarking that several most competent English-speaking scholars remain unconvinced by arguments which have apparently fully satisfied their German brethren. <abbr
      title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Wordsworth, Professor Plumptre, <abbr
      title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Taylor Lewis
    of America, argue that the book is really Solomon’s, while even in Germany D. H. A. Hahn (<i
      lang="de">Commentar über das Predigerbuch</i>,
    Leipzig, 1860) is strongly on the side of the Solomonic authorship.</p>
  <p>
    The principal arguments in favour of later date derived from internal evidence, arise from (<i>first</i>) the state of violence and misery
    <a id="a010"></a>depicted in the book with so much bitterness, and which, it is alleged, cannot be made to harmonize with what we know of the reign of Solomon; and (<i>secondly</i>) the strongly Aramaic character of the language, which assimilates itself to that of the books of Daniel and Esther. With regard to the first point (if we have at all found the real interpretation of the book), it seems improbable that any special description of a particular period could have been ever intended, or even any allusion to the special circumstances of any people. So far also from supposing a time of trouble in the mind of the writer, on the contrary the point and moral of the book will be enhanced if we suppose it to be written rather in a time of prosperity than of adversity or oppression. Thus, if we turn to the expressions of chapter <a
      href="#b028a"><abbr title="4">iv.</abbr> 1</a>
    we shall see that to give any special reference to them, and suppose them peculiar or out of the way, would weaken the force of Koheleth’s argument. Human life generally, under the very best of external circumstances, always exhibits the spectacle both of oppressions by the wicked, and of oppressed without comforters. Now underneath this statement lies the difficulty that He who permits this is the merciful Author of Nature Himself, and it is this difficulty which is especially discussed. There is no necessity to suppose the concluding years of Persian tyranny to be pointedly alluded to, because it is not under an Asiatic despotism alone that hypocrites come and go from the place of the holy (chapter <abbr
      title="8">viii.</abbr> 10),
    or servants are seen on horseback, and nobles, like serfs, walking afoot (chapter <abbr
      title="10">x.</abbr> 7),
    or that men continue in prosperous wickedness (chapter <abbr
      title="9">ix.</abbr> 3).
    Indeed, the same may be said of any other of the similar providential difficulties advanced in this book, for the very same occurrences may be witnessed now in this age of civilisation and progress. The reply then to the assertion that it is ‘impossible to reconcile this state of things with the age of Solomon’ is simply this. There is no need even to make the attempt, because there is no reason to believe that, considering the author’s standpoint, he intended that the instances of human suffering and disappointment he cites should be taken otherwise than perfectly generally. What he adduces of this nature is in sufficient measure true always, at the best of times. It would blunt the point of his reasoning if it could be shown that the difficulties he starts were exceptional or temporary; but this is not so. Koheleth’s repeated declaration is that <i>all</i>――that is, the whole of human life――is vanity or evanescence.</p>
  <p id="a011">
    The argument from Aramaic words is much more formidable, and would be conclusive if our knowledge of the successive stages of the Hebrew language were less fragmentary and uncertain than is really the case. It is quite true that such words as
      <span class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">מדינה</span>,
      <span class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">רעיון</span>,
      <span class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">רעות</span>,
      <span class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">כבר</span>,
      <span class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">זמן</span>,
      <span class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">פתגם</span>,
    have an Aramaic colouring; but we must set against this the fact that, as Ewald remarks, we have in Ecclesiastes a new philosophical terminology, which has modified the Hebrew of the book. And again, it will be seen by referring to the places where these peculiar words occur, that they are introduced either for the purposes of expressing new ideas or terms not found in the language elsewhere. Sometimes the more usual word would be out of harmony with the context, <abbr
      title="for example"><i>e.g.</i></abbr> the word <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">זמון</span>
    replaces the more ordinary <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">מיעד</span>,
    because not only is the latter used to signify a <i>feast</i>, but the root-meaning of the former is just what is required by the argument. Again, <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">כבר</span>,
    as will be seen stated at length in the notes, is used in the purely technical sense, of ‘this present,’ and not in the ordinary meaning of ‘already.’ The unusual <a
      id="a011a" href="#n_85">♦</a><span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">אלו</span>, chapter <abbr
      title="6">vi.</abbr> 6,
    also is apparently introduced for the sake of the alliteration with <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">הלא</span>
    in the next clause, and the once occurring <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">עֲדֶן</span> chapter <abbr
      title="4">iv.</abbr> 3,
    for the sake of the equivoke to which its use gives rise. All these Aramaic words are noticed as they occur in the body of the Commentary, and we think that the conclusion which results from what there appears is to weaken very considerably any argument as to date which can be drawn from them one way or the other.</p>
  <footer>
    <div class="tnote" id="n_85">

  <p>
    Again, the object of the book is so peculiar, and so different from all the rest of Scripture, and especially from those which, supposing Solomon was the author, would stand related to it in point of time, that we may well expect some difference of language and colouring. Again, also, there is another reason. The books immediately subsequent to Solomon’s era are all prophetic. Now it seems natural that prophets should use an antique style, which would be tinged with that of the earlier religious books, while if, on the other hand, as the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    seem to imply by their translation of the word Koheleth, and appears also from the alliterations in the book itself, it were an address orally delivered, it would no doubt contain colloquialisms. There are strong indications that it does so. Now these colloquialisms would certainly have an Aramaic cast about them. Thus the difference of diction between the Hebrew of Koheleth and a contemporary prophet would be exaggerated, and any estimate of date due to this difference proportionately uncertain.</p>
  <p id="a012">
    On the whole, for myself, I have no theory to support either way. I am content to let the matter rest, as I believe the Scripture itself leaves it, which, after all, nowhere refers the authorship to Solomon. In accordance with this, both to save space and to conduce to clearness, I have always referred to the author by the name Koheleth, and to the book itself as Ecclesiastes, in the course of the subsequent Commentary.</p>
  <p class="sectbrk align_ctr smcap_all">
    DESIGN AND METHOD OF THE WORK.</p>
  <p class="secthdbrk">
    The design of the book is no other than argumentatively to work out the concluding aphorism of the whole: ‘Fear God, and keep His commandments, for <i>this</i> is the whole problem of Humanity.’ This truth is never for a moment lost sight of, not even in those passages which sound most sceptical or Epicurean. We may compare this marvellous book to an overture, and say that this truth is its subject. This overture, however, is written in a minor key; it is almost always plaintive; sometimes it descends to what sounds like absolute discord; but this subject floats through its wildest and strangest melodies, resolves its harshest discords, connects its most erratic wanderings. Koheleth is a perfect master of sarcasm. A certain grim and bitter yet grave and holy satire runs through his book. He makes his readers think whether they will or no. For this purpose he sometimes descends to plays upon words, equivokes, alliterations, possibly also proverbs in ordinary circulation. He certainly writes in the ‘vulgar tongue.’ But these equivokes always help the sense. If Koheleth appears in the guise of a popular preacher, he never loses sight of the moralist and philosopher. His sermon, for such we believe it to be, will bear comparison with another wonderful sermon found in Holy Scripture, with which it has some striking points of resemblance, and yet how wonderfully different!</p>
  <p>
    The book then opens with an exclamation which serves as a text or topic――‘Vanity of vanities,’――and forthwith proceeds to state the question, and work out the conclusion which this topic suggests. Has mankind any advantage (in the sense of a result in the future) by reason of his toil or anxiety (the technical word here used is <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">עמל</span>,
    by which word is meant the same thing as the Greek expresses by <span
      class="grk" lang="grc">μέριμνα</span>,
    cares of this life, Matthew <abbr
      title="chapter 13">xiii.</abbr> 22)?
    This he answers in the negative by eight aphorisms, four drawn from observation of nature and four from moral considerations, which we have called the eight
    <a id="a013"></a><i>un</i>beatitudes of the sermon. This constitutes the first part of the proof. Koheleth then goes on to discuss the question, Can any solution of this providential difficulty be discovered? This, in the first place, is attempted to be answered by an autobiography, in which Koheleth shows in succession that wisdom, mirth, accumulation of wealth, <abbr
      title="and so forth">etc.</abbr>,
    are alike evanescent and unsatisfactory, as his own experience (and no one was likely to do better) abundantly displayed. These together form the first great division of the book――Chapters <span
        class="smcap_all"><abbr title="1">I.</abbr></span> and <span
        class="smcap_all"><abbr title="2">II.</abbr></span></p>
  <p>
    In the next five Chapters, <span
      class="smcap_all"><abbr title="3">III.</abbr></span> to <span
      class="smcap_all"><abbr title="7">VII.</abbr></span>,
    the same question is discussed from another point of view. Koheleth remarks on the unalterable character of Providence, and shows that even if it were possible that human wisdom could cause change (which it cannot), that the alteration could only be for the worse. He begins by enumerating twenty-eight times or seasons――that is, a fourfold seven――of which the last is ‘a time of peace.’ This is especially worthy of remark, as it is an instance of one of those hopes of better things which Koheleth allows to appear, as it were by stealth, amidst his most melancholy utterances. He then argues this matter, and through a long and sustained course of reasoning, the conclusion of which is, that God must right the wronged.</p>
  <p>
    But there naturally arises the objection, If this be so, why does impiety and oppression exist so continually in the very places or circumstances where we ought to expect the reverse? To this Koheleth offers two solutions, which, however, are neither satisfactory; the second indeed would lead to absolute scepticism. The true deduction is however stated in the last verse of chapter <abbr
      title="3">iii.</abbr> (22),
    which is, that if any result is to be accomplished by human toil, it can only consist in present gratification.</p>
  <p>
    Koheleth then turns to the consideration of oppressions or afflictions, this turn of thought being that present enjoyment is marred by the existence of so much irremediable unhappiness; that if this world be all, the dead are better off than the living; that the result even of success is envy rather than pleasure; that it is useless labouring for posterity, and no avail in the present. Koheleth here sarcastically points out that labour for others does give some advantage, the only instance where he sees the possibility of any at all. He carefully limits, however, all this to the present life, this formula ‘under the sun,’ <abbr
      title="that is"><i>i.e.</i></abbr>
    in this world of labour and toil, being introduced frequently, showing that all he says is to be taken with this proviso.</p>
  <p id="a014">
    In Chapter <span class="smcap_all"><abbr
      title="5">V.</abbr></span>
    Koheleth begins to display the great remedy for human ills――that is, piety, patience, and submission to the Divine will, cautioning against foolish sacrifices, rash vows, rash speeches, selfishness and avarice. This display of the remedy, however, is as yet subordinate, the main object being to show that all arguments conspire to prove the vanity or transitoriness of human existence. With this Chapter <span
      class="smcap_all"><abbr title="6">VI.</abbr></span>
    ends, and with it the more argumentative portion of the treatise.</p>
  <p>
    Chapter <span class="smcap_all"><abbr
      title="7">VII.</abbr></span>
    opens with a paradoxical statement of seven good things, which look like evil ones, and on this Koheleth develops the thought that man does not know a good thing when he sees it. He shows that even wisdom itself will not necessarily produce happiness in this world, though this, he is sure, is a good thing; but he is very bitter and sarcastic on those who, because right does not always succeed, resort to impiety; this, he shows, is a great and fatal mistake. Though the proposition that piety is happiness is not formally stated or worked out argumentatively, nevertheless this is proved so completely that Koheleth is able at the end of the whole to cite this as the real result of his argument.</p>
  <p>
    If, however, piety be the remedy for human ills, early piety is essential to tolerable ease and quiet in this world. This is set forth in the same paradoxical and sarcastic way as before. We are advised to avoid certain evils while we can. These are described with great pathos in Chapter <span
      class="smcap_all"><abbr title="12">XII.</abbr></span>
    It is however, we believe, quite a mistake to imagine that the close of the book contains an <i>allegorical</i> description of old age. The weakness and other trials of age are, no doubt, brought before us in very poetic and picturesque language. There is an Oriental richness and floridness about this language at first strange to Western ears; but the images employed all admit of resolution by an appeal to the usage of Scripture elsewhere, and can be shown to be quite in place. The conclusion of the whole is significantly the same as the topic at the beginning, ‘Vanity of vanities, the whole is vanity.’</p>
  <p>
    The Epilogue, chapter <abbr title="12">xii.</abbr> 9, follows. This has been pronounced by some to be an interpolation, the work of a later hand; but we could no more imagine a book of the Old Testament ending with such an aphorism as vanity of vanities, without doing violence to our critical instinct, than we could believe that the Gospel of <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark
    was ever intended to end with the words ‘They were afraid’ [<span
      class="grk" lang="grc">ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ</span>, Mark <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 8].
    It is rather the bold, open statement of the truth,
    <a id="a015"></a>which has in a more or less covered manner formed the subject of the whole book. The aphorism, ‘Fear God and keep His commandments,’ contains the only possible solution of providential difficulties or remedy of human ills, and it is in vain to look for any other. The reasons for this mystery we must leave to God alone. He will bring into judgment――<abbr
      title="that is"><i>i.e.</i></abbr>
    into adjustment or declared consistency with justice――every mystery, whether to our notions good or evil. With this assurance the book appropriately ends.</p>
  <p class="sectbrk align_ctr smcap_all">
    GRAMMATICAL PECULIARITIES.</p>
  <p class="secthdbrk">
    The Book of Ecclesiastes being a didactic and argumentative treatise, and the only work of its kind in the Scriptures, its Hebrew is modified to meet the requirements of that which is a new philosophy, so that we may fully indorse Ewald’s expression, that ‘Koheleth uses the Hebrew language as a flexible instrument for the expression of novel ideas.’ This naturally implies a usage of words and phrases peculiar to this book, and accounts for the large number of unusual forms and once occurring words and the like which here meet us. It will be apparent to any who will diligently examine the text, that Koheleth confines himself very strictly indeed to the rules of his own grammar, and uses articles, prepositions, and tenses with an accuracy not inferior to Greek itself. For example, there is a real distinction to be discovered between the usage of masculine and feminine forms, where a substantive is of both genders. It is not a matter of indifference whether the full relative is used or the contracted form; on the contrary, it will be seen that the contracted relative gives an optative or subjunctive sense; or whether a verb governs directly or through the intervention of the particle <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">את</span>;
    a distinction which the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    were quite aware of, and which gave rise to their adverbial <span
      class="grk" lang="grc">σὺν</span>.
    What, for want of a better term, we have called distributive plurals――<abbr
      title="that is"><i>i.e.</i></abbr>
    a singular noun and plural verb in agreement, or <i>vice versâ</i>――are exceedingly significant. They have a peculiar shade of meaning, according to circumstances and position in the sentence. It is too a matter of some consequence whether the nominative precedes or follows the verb; hence in the running translation this order is never reversed, even where our idiom requires it, but explanatory words are introduced. All these matters are, where necessary, pointed out in the notes――perhaps some may imagine pressed too far, and repeated <i
      lang="la">ad nauseam</i>; but the excuse must be that
    <a id="a016"></a>on these minutiæ depend the evidence of correct rendering. If thus a good sense is made out, as it were spontaneously, and which, moreover, is found to fall into place as it occurs in the context, we have strong evidence that we have hit the real meaning.</p>
  <p>
    Connected with this grammatical usage is a peculiar terminology, also to be expected in a scientific treatise. Thus <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">דבר</span>
    is very commonly rendered in this Commentary by ‘reasoning,’ the exact idea implied being a matter or thing reasoned about, with the further notion or conclusion that this reason will become ground of action. No single English or even Greek word will render it, but once let us master its real significance, and the force and cogency of many passages will become manifest. Again, <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">חפץ</span>,
    which has the sense of ‘an agreeable occurrence,’ ‘a providence,’ and then generally of ‘any event,’ in this book denotes a ‘<i>providential</i> occurrence.’ Again, <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">עמל</span>
    is not exactly toil, but the fatigue, distress, or anxiety that comes of it. It differs from <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">ענין</span>,
    which is also anxiety, but that kind of anxiety which comes of uncertainty as to a future result. Two most important words are <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">סכלות</span> and <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">הללות</span>:
    the former is that kind of folly which has the appearance of wisdom, clever folly, or foolish wisdom; the latter is that kind of folly which is begotten of a false expectation of the result, as in our expression ‘made a fool of.’ So again <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">כבר</span>
    is not an adverb ‘already,’ but rather a substantive,――this present considered as now existing. These technical words are all noticed as they occur, and a sense given, the proof of the correctness of which is that appropriate meaning is made in every place in which they occur. As several are found nowhere else in Scripture, this is the only true method of coming at their meaning. It is also worthy of notice that these words occur usually seven or ten times, or some other round or mystic number. This happens so frequently that it can hardly be accidental, but I have seldom been able to trace any rule or law in this circumstance. On the whole, however, it may be taken as an axiom that when Koheleth uses a peculiar word, he intends to express a peculiar idea, and his meaning must be sought accordingly. Careful attention to this point clears up many difficulties.</p>
  <p>
    Alliteration and paronomasia occur with great and characteristic frequency, a proof surely that the book was intended to be preached or delivered as an address. It is, of course, very difficult to give these in the English version. Sometimes in the paraphrastic translation this is attempted by means of rhymes and alliterations.
    <a id="a017"></a>I can hardly pronounce these quite successful, and often have felt inclined to return to a more literal rendering, but then this most characteristic feature of the book would have been lost to the English reader. Every one who has ever addressed an assembly knows how very telling these hits are, and moreover they are of real importance to the commentator, as bringing the words on which the alliteration depends into artificial prominence. There is a danger, no doubt, that when once the mind is aroused to this, that equivokes should be found where they were not intended; but of this the reader must judge.</p>
  <p>
    This perhaps is the best point at which to discuss the meaning of the word Koheleth. In its present form and pointing <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">קֹהֶלֶת</span>
    is the active feminine participle of Kal of the verb <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">קהל</span>,
    occurring as a verb only in niphal and hiphil. The feminine noun occurs Deuteronomy <abbr
      title="chapter 33">xxxiii.</abbr> 4, <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">קְהִלַּת</span>――<abbr
      title="that is"><i>i.e.</i></abbr>
    this word differently pointed――which the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr> render by <span
      class="grk" lang="grc">συναγωγῆς</span>. <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">קְהִלַּת</span>
    occurs Nehemiah <abbr
      title="chapter 5">v.</abbr> 7, rendered <span
      class="grk" lang="grc">ἐκκλησίαν</span>.
    With this before us it seems beside the mark to seek a meaning out of the root <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">קהל</span>.
    According to the usage observable in this book, feminines (we should prefer to call them abstracts) in <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">ת</span>
    differ from those in <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">ה</span>――compare <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">עמדת</span>, chapter <abbr
      title="1">i.</abbr> 4;
    the abstract in this form again becomes as it were a concrete. Thus we should incline to indorse the view enunciated by Preston, who considers the word to be represented by ‘collector’ or ‘concionator’ in Latin. Both these meanings we believe are contained in the word, and it is quite consistent with what we know of the style of Ecclesiastes to admit that both these meanings were intended to be conveyed. The discourse is a collection of separate but connected aphorisms on the transitoriness of human existence――the author is thus a collector of them; and as the discourse was delivered apparently when collected, he is a concionator or preacher also. The word used by the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>, <span
      class="grk" lang="grc">ἐκκλησιαστὴς</span>,
    occurs nowhere else, either in the Old or New Testaments, so that the <i>precise</i> meaning they affixed to the word is unknown. In classical Greek it means preacher.</p>
  <p>
    The repetition of a word, whether substantive or particle, in the same sentence, of course gives emphasis to that word; to translate accurately, therefore, when this occurs, we have to add some English equivalent, such as ‘this’ or ‘as well,’ and so forth, see Commentary <i
      lang="la">passim</i>.
    A careful attention to this rule will often considerably help to clear up obscure passages.</p>
  <p class="sectbrk align_ctr smcap_all" id="a018">
    ON THE PECULIAR RENDERINGS OF THE VERSION OF THE <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr></p>
  <p class="secthdbrk">
    The remark of Delitzsch on the translation of the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>,
    affixed to the Book of Psalms (Delitzsch on the Psalms, Clark’s Library, Edinburgh) may be introduced here:――‘This translation, as being the oldest key to the understanding of the language of the Old Testament writings, as being the oldest mirror of the Old Testament text, and as an important check upon the interpretation of Scripture handed down in the Talmud and Midrash, and in that portion of the national literature not originating in Egypt, is invaluable.’ For this remark applies to the rendering of Ecclesiastes in an equal, if not greater degree, and may be offered as an excuse, if one be needed, for the comparatively large space assigned to the discussion of the Septuagint renderings.</p>
  <p>
    A peculiarity which meets us in this book is the occurrence of the preposition <span
      class="grk" lang="grc">σὺν</span>
    followed by an accusative, and in one case a genitive, and which seldom if ever occurs in other books. This apparently trifling circumstance, which is usually treated as a barbarism, will give the clue which will lead to some curious and interesting facts connected with the methods of translation adopted by the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr></p>
  <p>
    If we examine carefully and in detail the wording of the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    we can hardly fail to be struck with the excessive care that is taken to render in the exact order of the Hebrew――a remark which may be extended to other portions of this version, the Book of Job being, however, a striking exception, (and when there is any considerable departure, in almost every instance hitherto examined a serious variation of text in the different recensions of the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    will be found to occur.) In Ecclesiastes this order is so strict that, with hardly an exception, it would be possible to print the Greek text as it stands as an interlinear translation. This most interesting point deserves further investigation than appears as yet to have been given to it. My own impression from this circumstance, is that the version of the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    was made with the idea that those who used it had the Hebrew before them, and this hypothesis, for in truth it is nothing more, will I think group together more facts than any other suppositions which have been adopted to explain these strange renderings met with in the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>,――as,
    for example, variation of original text, wilful corruption on the part of the translators, Hagadic influence (of which more presently), and the like. The <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    have executed their work so well, that notwithstanding
    <a id="a019"></a>this restriction which they thus laid upon themselves, we have a very good translation, which for many centuries was used as the sole representative of the ancient Scriptures, and on which the whole fabric of ancient theology was erected.</p>
  <p>
    This interlinear character, as we may call it, of the version of the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>,
    will explain why they render the same Hebrew word by such very different Greek equivalents. In an interlinear translation there is no special value in uniform rendering; rather the reverse. It is better even to study variety than uniformity, although we believe that the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    do neither the one nor the other, but simply endeavour to give the best possible rendering of the passage before them. For example, the word <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">חפץ</span>
    is rendered in chapter <abbr
      title="3">iii.</abbr> 1, 17, <abbr
      title="chapter 5">v.</abbr> 8 (7), <abbr
      title="chapter 8">viii.</abbr> 6, by <span
      class="grk" lang="grc">πρᾶγμα</span>,
    and in the other three cases in which it occurs, <abbr
      title="in particular">viz.</abbr>, chapter <abbr
      title="5">v.</abbr> 4 (3), <abbr
      title="chapter 12">xii.</abbr> 1, 10, by <span
      class="grk" lang="grc">θέλημα</span>.
    Now the real meaning of this word, as we have shown, is an agreeable providential occurrence, or, since all providential occurrences imply the Divine will on their side, any such whatever. The <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    use the one rendering or the other as best suits the context. This book containing so large a number of technical words, the meaning of which is to be sought by a careful comparison of all the passages in which they occur, the renderings of the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    become of special interest. The meaning compounded of the meanings of the <abbr
      title="Septuagint’s">LXX.’s</abbr>
    renderings, to use a mathematical simile, will give us often the precise shade of signification of the Hebrew of which we are in search, and this will then approve itself as correct by its suitableness in every instance.</p>
  <p>
    The same observation applies to the grammar of the Greek as representing that of the Hebrew. There is no attempt whatever to render Hebrew grammatical forms with any uniformity. Hebrew perfects are rendered by Greek presents, aorists, or perfects; Hebrew presents by aorists or perfects. Participles are rendered sometimes by participles, at others by principal verbs. The same Hebrew prepositions are sometimes rendered by different Greek prepositions, and sometimes simply by case-endings. The relative is rendered by the relative, by the pronoun, and by <span
      class="grk" lang="grc">ὅτι</span>.
    The Hebrew conjugations are not represented on any settled principle; Piels are sometimes indeed apparently marked by a preposition compounded with the verb, sometimes not noticed at all. In certain cases in which the root is doubtful, as for example in ain vaw, and ain ain verbs, the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    do not always follow the Masoretic pointing and derivation. On the whole, however, the deviations of the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>,
    from both pointing and accentuation, are more apparent than real, and may be explained, for
    <a id="a020"></a>the most part, on the principle that the translators felt themselves obliged to follow the order of the words in the original.</p>
  <p>
    We must, however, bear in mind that the present text of the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    is of all texts the most time-worn, and often requires correction. Most providentially we do not depend on one recension; we have in existing copies the remains of several, and we may make use of them to restore the original readings. The problem in this case differs essentially from that which meets us in revising the Greek text of the New Testament. Here diplomatic evidence has not the same weight as there. Emendations may be detected, even when better readings of the Hebrew, by want of conformity to the Hebrew order (and the temptation to make such kind of alterations, when the version was used independently, would clearly be very great), or again a comparison of the various readings will enable us to guess with tolerable confidence what the Hebrew originally was. In this way, when the Hebrew text is doubtful, we can ascertain the correct reading by searching for that common origin from which the variants in the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    were derived, and we may then turn round on the version with the help of the Hebrew, and show how the changes successively arose. An instance of this will be found at chapter <abbr
      title="10">x.</abbr> 10;
    how far I have succeeded the reader must judge. We must also bear in mind that what we should now denote by marginal renderings are in the ancient versions inserted in the text. The interlinear character of the version enables us to detect this: we find two Greek words standing in place of a single Hebrew equivalent. The result of all this, as applied in the Book of Ecclesiastes, is to vindicate the accuracy of the received Hebrew text, and, in a less degree, of the pointing and accentuation also. Only in a very few instances is it needful to propose an emendation of the Hebrew text, and that where the ancient versions are apparently unanimous in requiring it.</p>
  <p>
    There remains another point, however. <abbr
      title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Ginsburg
    (and from his extensive acquaintance with Jewish literature no one is better qualified to give an opinion) considers that Hagadic influence must be taken largely into account in explaining difficult passages in Ecclesiastes; amongst other points he notices the rendering of <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">את</span> by <span
      class="grk" lang="grc">σὺν</span>,
    which has been referred to already. ‘Commentators,’ he says, ‘have been perplexed to account for this barbarism, and violation of grammatical propriety, but a reference to Hagadic exegesis will show that this Hebrew particle was looked up to as having a mystical signification, because the two letters, <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">א</span> and <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">ת</span>,
    of which it is composed, are the Alpha and Omega of the Hebrew alphabet.
    <a id="a021"></a>Hence the anxiety of the translator to indicate this particle in Greek, when a passage appeared to him to be fraught with special mysteries.’ But, as he remarks, it is only in twenty-nine instances out of seventy-one occurrences of this particle that it is so rendered by the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr> Moreover, <abbr
      title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Ginsburg
    has not shown that these passages are specially mysterious. They are in fact neither more nor less so than some others in which this particle is not so rendered. An examination of these passages will show, we think convincingly, that what the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    wished to do was to point out that <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">את</span>
    was emphatic and with the meaning of ‘respect to,’ or the like, as will be seen by reference to the Commentary, especially chapters <abbr
      title="2">ii.</abbr> 17, <abbr
      title="3">iii.</abbr> 17, <abbr
      title="7">vii.</abbr> 26, <abbr
      title="8">viii.</abbr> 8, 15.</p>
  <p>
    The Hagadic influence, according to <abbr
      title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Ginsburg,
    is still more evident in the peculiar rendering of chapter <abbr
      title="2">ii.</abbr> 12, as well as chapters <abbr
      title="2">ii.</abbr> 17, <abbr
      title="3">iii.</abbr> 15, <abbr
      title="4">iv.</abbr> 17, <abbr
      title="5">v.</abbr> 1,
    all which are fully treated in the Commentary, and the renderings of the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    explained and elucidated, it is hoped satisfactorily. So far from the true explanation of these renderings being found in the Chaldee paraphrase, as <abbr
      title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Ginsburg
    imagines, that version gives distorted interpretations of passages but partially understood. Again, the gloss of the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr> at chapter <abbr
      title="2">ii.</abbr> 15
    is shared by the Syriac, and is a marginal reading; chapter <abbr
      title="2">ii.</abbr> 17
    is a verbatim reading of the Hebrew in every particular; and the gloss at chapter <abbr
      title="2">ii.</abbr> 9
    is too evidently foisted in from the margin to make it of much value in any argument. See note there.</p>
  <p>
    Holding as I do the paramount authority of the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>,
    I have not scrupled to follow them against the Masoretic interpretation when the sense of a passage seemed to require it, and I deem it a sufficient answer to any objections on this head, that the rendering proposed is supported by the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    On the whole, however, these differences are, as remarked above, not very great, and we have rather occasion for surprise, not that there is here and there a divergence, but that on the whole there is so substantial agreement. The pointing which we have in our Hebrew Bibles embodies a most valuable and venerable tradition, but in its present form younger by centuries than that furnished by the rendering of the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    While, therefore, we admit its great value, we ought not to make its authority absolute, and this is done to all intents and purposes by those who reject without question the ancient interpretation because it conflicts with the present pointing. No language is too high to characterize our obligations to those Jewish fathers who have guarded so faithfully that special trust committed to them――the oracles of God. But
    <a id="a022"></a>the Synagogue is no more infallible in matters of criticism than is the Church. Neither the Masorets nor the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    are inspired, though inspiration has been by their respective partisans vehemently claimed for both. Each party, also, has unduly depreciated the other, and the Hebrew scholars have been for centuries divided into punctists and anti-punctists. But as there is no royal road to learning, so there is no short-cut to certainty; the whole evidence, let it come from whence it may, must be diligently weighed and compared. So far as the version of the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    is concerned, this is not done until their errors, or supposed errors, have been at least duly explained and accounted for, even when their renderings are rejected.</p>
  <p class="sectbrk align_ctr smcap_all">
    OTHER VERSIONS OF ANTIQUITY.</p>
  <p class="secthdbrk">
    Next in order in point of antiquity to the version of the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    stands the Syriac Peshito. This I have sometimes quoted in the present Commentary, having considered it my duty to make myself acquainted with this version, so that if I am not in a position to offer anything of my own, I can follow other commentators, and test their accuracy. The citations are made from the edition of <abbr
      title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Lee,
    published by the Bible Society. As might be expected, the Syriac version stands midway between the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    and Masoretic text, agreeing sometimes with the one and sometimes with the other. It is often assumed that the peculiar renderings of the Syriac which agree with the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    against the Masoretic rendering, arise from corrections of the former text by the latter; this, however, is not proved. The existence of such an element of correction may well be admitted, but it is only one out of many, and in some cases we shall, I think, have reason to conclude that the sense, set aside as of no critical value by some commentators, does in fact embody the real meaning of the passage under discussion. See chapter <a
      href="#b072c"><abbr title="10">x.</abbr> 10</a>
    for an instance of this.</p>
  <p>
    The Vulgate is generally accessible; its value is subordinate as compared with the above-mentioned versions, being only, as is well known, corrected from the Hebrew by Jerome. Sometimes, however, the evidence it affords of an ancient reading is all the more valuable on this account. See the note at chapter <a
      href="#b072c"><abbr title="10">x.</abbr> 10.</a></p>
  <p>
    The fragments of the ancient Greek versions of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion are often of the very highest value, and diligent use has been made of them. The edition used is that of Field, <i
      lang="la">Originis Hexapla</i>,
    edition by Fridericus Field, Oxford, 1867, <abbr
      title="volume 2">vol. ii.</abbr> The
    <a id="a023"></a><i lang="la">Codex Syriaco Hexaplaris</i>, H. Middedorpf, Berlin, 1835, has also been examined.</p>
  <p class="sectbrk align_ctr smcap_all">
    THE TRANSLATIONS OF THIS COMMENTARY.</p>
  <p class="secthdbrk">
    Two translations of this book are here offered to the reader, the first, dispersed through the notes, denoted by bold-faced type, is absolutely literal, even to utter baldness, and rigidly follows the exact order of the Hebrew. In the accompanying running commentary the construction of the sentences is carefully pointed out, the rendering of the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    noted where peculiar, and the attempt made in all cases to account for the peculiarity, either by showing that they have preserved the true interpretation, or else explaining how the error arose. The sense thus obtained is embodied in the paraphrastic version printed at the head of the page. There has been no attempt made to adopt, in this latter translation, the phraseology of the Authorized Version; rather the reverse, as it is not intended to be independent, but is to be regarded as of the nature of an explanatory commentary or an English Targum upon the text. It also seeks to render idea for idea rather than word for word, and gives in every case the meaning which on the whole seemed most probable, and squared best with the context. It attempts also to represent equivokes and alliterations in the original, by corresponding equivokes and alliterations――not necessarily in the equivalent words of the translation,――and points out, by figures, italics, and other typographical signs, instances of artificial arrangement of topics and the like; see Chapters <span
      class="smcap_all"><abbr title="1">I.</abbr></span> and <span
      class="smcap_all"><abbr title="2">II.</abbr></span>, <abbr
      title="and so forth">etc.</abbr>
    To the English reader a caution is here needed. The very nature of such a version requires that all be made to run quite smoothly; thus, however obscure the passage, a sense is given, and difficulties are put out of sight. But after all this only represents the meaning the commentator thinks most probable, and he may be quite wrong, and altogether mistaken. Such a version is after all a Targum――in other words, a well-meaning attempt at explanation, with some amplification, of the sacred text. In dealing then with it let the reader imitate the Jews of old, who, when they read the sacred text itself, did so with every outward manifestation of respect and deference; but when they came to read the Targum altered their manner, and showed by posture and gesture that they clearly regarded this as but a mere exposition of the Divine Word, and of no authority.</p>

    The following works are assumed to be easily accessible to English readers:――<i>Ecclesiastes</i>, Theodore Preston, London, 1845; <i>Commentary on Ecclesiastes</i>, Moses Stuart, New York, 1851; <i>Coheleth</i>, by Christian

      title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Ginsburg
    especially will be found indispensable. <abbr
      title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Ginsburg
    has stated at length, and for the most part in the writers’ own words, the different opinions of critics, Jewish and Christian, who have written on this book. His vast reading and erudition are thus made available for future scholars. Once for all, I must acknowledge the deep obligation I am under to his work. If in many of my renderings I am compelled to differ from him, I am not the less indebted to him on that account. If I have really seen further than he has, it is only because he has, so to speak, allowed me to mount on his shoulders. Any one who takes the trouble to compare my work with his will see that most of my renderings could have been supported by a name of weight. If, however, I have the authority of the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    in my favour, I am content, and cite no others. I have, however, not failed to resort to such of the commentators in <abbr
      title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Ginsburg’s
    list, German and English, as well as some published since the appearance of his book, as would be likely to give additional light.</p>

      <b>in all his toil</b> (<span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">עמל</span>,
      a favourite word of Koheleth, and used as frequently in this book as in all the rest of Scripture put together. The exact meaning to be affixed to it, and which, carefully kept in view, will be found to explain more than one otherwise obscure passage, is that toil, care, or anxiety which labour produces, and answers to the idea contained in our metaphor ‘takes <i>pains</i>;’ see chapter <a
        href="#b017a"><abbr title="2">ii.</abbr> 20</a>),
      <b>which he toils at</b> (this is the first instance which occurs of the contracted relative <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">ש־</span>
      joined to the word. Koheleth uses also the full relative <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">אשר</span>,
      but with a slight difference of meaning. The contracted relative refers to the word only which it joins, and in case of verbs often gives a subjunctive or optative meaning; the full relative refers back to the whole idea or clause. Hence the meaning of this passage is this, ‘Is there any abiding advantage to humanity of the pains of his labouring in so far as he does take pains, or toils’) <b>under the sun</b> (or in this present state of existence). The phrase <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">תחת השמש</span>
      occurs twenty-five times in this book, and is always expressive of a limitation. It shows that what is affirmed is to be understood as confined to its relation to this sublunary existence only. The idea implied is that of man toiling under the sun in the heat of the day in the sweat of his brow (Genesis <abbr
        title="chapter 3">iii.</abbr> 17),
      and earnestly desiring the shadow (Job <abbr
        title="chapter 7">vii.</abbr> 2),
      which shadow is yet the symbol of decaying life. It is true that Ecclesiastes is never quoted in the New Testament, but there are certainly several allusions to it, more or less direct; one of these apparently occurs Revelation <abbr

      shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the sun light on them by day, nor any heat.’ The Chaldee Targum expresses this idea quaintly but forcibly: ‘What advantage is there to a man after his death from all his labour which he laboured under the sun in this world, except he studied the word of God, in order to receive a good reward in the world to come from before the Lord of the world?’ In order to remind the reader of this meaning of the words ‘under the sun,’ I have whenever they occur paraphrased them by ‘in this hot work-day world’――not that this paraphrase is quite satisfactory, but it is the best I could find.</p>

Bengel’s definition, ‘the present period in its quality, course, and account,’ is exactly what the word signifies in this book. It is to be noticed that each instance of change is followed by a sentence which points out that this change is resultless. In the first, the fluctuating and fleeting generations or life-periods of man contrast with the absolute endurance of an unchanged order of things). ‘The great mill-wheel of existence only revolves for the same cogs to come uppermost again and again.’――[Hamilton, <i>Royal Preacher</i>.]</p>

This remark is the more important because it is one of those so-called Aramaic words, the occurrence of which is supposed to indicate the late period of this book’s composition. A careful observance of its real import will throw considerable light on several very obscure passages. Generally, it may be taken for granted that if Koheleth uses a new word or form not known in other parts of the Scriptures, it is because he desires to indicate a new idea.) <b>It was to the ages which</b> (full relative, referring back, therefore, to the whole sentence) <b>were from before us</b> (as we have ages in the plural, followed by a singular verb, <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">היה</span>,

    <p class="thbrk">
      This then forms the first division of the book. By these eight instances Koheleth proves the existence of unceasing toilsome care and resultless progression in all human things. He proceeds in the next place to give his own personal experience, in the form of an autobiography to the same effect. All commentators, even those who deny that Solomon himself was the author of this book, are agreed that he is the hero, and that his life and experience form the groundwork of what is here set before us.</p>

        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">רעה</span>,
      which is ‘evil,’ in the sense of something that ‘hurts’ or ‘offends,’ and is in the nature of a collective plural; so do we account at once for the peculiar pointing and for the rendering of the <abbr
        title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
      On the other hand, <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">רעיון</span>
      has, as nouns with this termination usually have, a more subjective meaning; the distinction between the two is that between ‘vexations of’ and ‘vexing of’ spirit; thus in verse 17, where the trouble came from his own spirit, caused by his inability to explain the difficulty which confronted him in his argument, Koheleth uses the subjective form).</p>

The meaning of this verse has been very much disputed, but if it be considered as the sequel to what went immediately before, the sense will be quite plain. We may discern in it a fourfold description of human life, in respect of its cares and anxieties and uncertainties, the first point being (<abbr

      this care is for something evanescent; (<abbr

(This passage is one of great difficulty, but the exact sense will become apparent on investigating the meaning of the two words <span

        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">שכלות</span>; now <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">הוללות</span>
      occurs chapter <abbr

        title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr> 12, <abbr
        title="chapter 7">vii.</abbr> 25,

        title="chapter 10">x.</abbr> 13,
      and is peculiar to Ecclesiastes. It is a technical word, and is correctly translated ‘folly,’ but it is that kind of folly which displays itself in false joy. The future poel from which this noun is derived occurs Job <abbr
        title="chapter 12">xii.</abbr> 17, chapter <abbr
        title="7">vii.</abbr> 7, Isaiah <abbr
        title="chapter 44">xliv.</abbr> 25;
      and the participle at chapter <abbr
        title="2">ii.</abbr> 2, Psalm <abbr
        title="chapter 102">cii.</abbr> 89.
      Thus we see the connexion between this sense and the more ordinary one of ‘praise;’ it is the ‘bepraised’ used in a bad sense. The word <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">שכלות</span>
      occurs here only, but it is rendered by the <abbr
        title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr> <span
        class="grk" lang="grc">ἐπιστήμη</span>,
      and by the Syriac <img

      compare also Genesis <abbr
        title="chapter 41">xli.</abbr> 33,
      with the meaning ‘prudence,’ and with this agrees the later Hebrew. Now these meanings make consistent sense. Koheleth wished to know wisdom and the knowledge of folly and prudence; in other words, to have a wisdom which could tell the one from the other. Thus the <abbr
        title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr> render <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">הל״</span> by <span
        class="grk" lang="grc">παραβολὰς</span>, which <abbr
        title="Alexandrine Edition">A²</abbr> has altered into <span
        class="grk" lang="grc">περιφορὰν</span>;
      this apparently very strange rendering is thus intelligible enough, especially to those who had the Hebrew before them. To alter the text to <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">סכלות</span>,
      as some have proposed, is not even to cut the Gordian knot, for with the true meaning of this word, ‘clever-folly,’ ‘false-wisdom,’ no better sense will be made, although it is quite possible that <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">שכ״</span>
      may have been chosen for the equivoke it gives, not even differing in sound, if the pointing can be trusted, from <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">סכ״</span>.
      The truth is that so much of our elaborate wisdom and best plans are but elaborate mistakes, that to attempt to judge the one from the other is a hopeless task. Hence then the following) <b>I know</b> (this is the fourth time this word occurs in the clause, thus it is brought out with the very strongest prominence, and gives the meaning ‘what I do know is’) <b>that even this</b> (<span

        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">רעיון</span>, not <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">רעות</span>,
      as above; because in this case the vexation is subjective,――the idea conveyed by the whole passage being ‘what I do know as the result of my wisdom and knowledge being just even this, that it is only a vexing of the spirit’). It may be observed that <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">רעיון</span>
      occurs in the Chaldee of Daniel――see Daniel <abbr
        title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr> 29, 30; <abbr

        title="chapter 5">v.</abbr> 6, <abbr
        title="and so forth">etc.</abbr>,
      always in the sense of a ‘<i>painful</i> reflection,’ but in later Chaldee and Syriac as ‘a reflection’ of any kind. As the sense in which Koheleth uses the word is the nearest to the root-meaning, is it not an evidence, so far, of earlier composition of his book?</p>

      but, as Field remarks (Hexapla, <abbr
        title="page">p.</abbr> 384),
      it is doubtful whether the Syriac text reads <img
        class="inline vert_m"
        style="height: 1.4em;"
        alt="(‡ Syriac word)"
        src="images/i_b014a.png">,
      ‘king,’ or <img

        style="height: 1.4em;"
        alt="(‡ Syriac word)"
        src="images/i_b014b.png">,
      ‘counsel.’ In the same way, Theodotion reads <span
        class="grk" lang="grc">σὺν τὰ ὅσα ἐποίησαν αὐτήν</span>.</p>
    <p>
      We must observe that all these versions, without exception, omit to notice <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">כבר</span>,
      which everywhere else is noted by <span
        class="grk" lang="grc">ἤδη</span>, being content with <span
        class="grk" lang="grc">τὰ ὅσα</span> or <span
        class="grk" lang="grc">σὺν τὰ ὅσα</span>.
      The explanation of these difficulties seems to be that <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">המלך</span>
      was probably intended to be equivocal. It is, to say the least, not impossible that it had, even in Solomon’s time, the meaning of ‘counsel,’ which attaches to it as a usual signification in Aramaic; if so, <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">המלך</span>
      means <i>the</i> counsel, and of course has the idea of rule as well. Castell gives as the meaning of <img
        class="inline vert_m"
        style="height: 1.4em;"
        alt="(‡ Syriac word)"
        src="images/i_b014c.png">,
      ‘Intellectum, Consilium dedit,’ vel ‘inivit,’ ‘Consultavit,’ ‘Promisit,’ ‘Pollicitus est;’ thus we must
      <a id="b015"></a>understand it to mean, ‘plans formed and intended to be carried out.’ The question then which Koheleth asks is this, ‘Who is the man who will enter upon――as we say, <i>carry out</i>――his plans with respect to that which in the present moment he makes them or devises them;’ in other words, can he carry out what he now devises, and can <i>any</i> man do this out of the number of human creatures who make these plans? This is the reason of the distributive plural which the best recensions of the <abbr
        title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
      preserve. The equivoke involved in the meaning ‘king’ is obvious. Koheleth himself is, of course, <i>the</i> king: could any one do better than he? It must be allowed that this meaning makes excellent sense with the context, and violates no Hebrew grammar. If, however, I have failed in giving a real interpretation of this most difficult passage, I may be excused a conjecture which is as plausible as many that have been advanced on this point. The corruptions of the old versions may be explained by the fact that the equivoke was lost so soon as readers ceased to have the Hebrew text before them, and hence the attempt to better their text. This most obscure passage may perhaps receive some light from a further discussion of the word <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">כבר</span>
      and other forms derived from the same root. The feminine or abstract occurs Genesis <abbr
        title="chapter 35">xxxv.</abbr> 16, <abbr
        title="chapter 48">xlviii.</abbr> 7, and 2 Kings <abbr
        title="chapter 5">v.</abbr> 19, joined with <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">ארץ</span>,
      rendered in the Authorized Version a ‘little’ way. The verb occurs in hiphil, Job <abbr
        title="chapter 35">xxxv.</abbr> 16, <abbr
        title="chapter 36">xxxvi.</abbr> 31,
      translated ‘multiplied,’ ‘in abundance;’ and in the hiphil form, with the characteristic <i>jud̄</i> inserted――Job <abbr
        title="chapter 8">viii.</abbr> 2, <abbr
        title="chapter 15">xv.</abbr> 10, <abbr
        title="and so forth">etc.</abbr>; Isaiah <abbr
        title="chapter 10">x.</abbr> 13, <abbr
        title="chapter 17">xvii.</abbr> 12, <abbr
        title="and so forth">etc.</abbr>――in
      the sense of ‘full of years,’ ‘overflowing,’ and the like. A diligent comparison of these meanings shows that ‘fulness,’ in the sense of ‘completeness,’ must be the root-meaning; and hence, when applied to time, the <abbr
        title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr> render <span
        class="grk" lang="grc">ἤδη</span>,
      ‘already.’ With this meaning agree also the Arabic and Syriac, see Fuerst, Lexicon, <abbr

      The meaning then of the word is, the ‘<i>complete</i> present.’ With regard to the use of the root <span

        title="chapter 4">iv.</abbr> 27 (24).
      This meaning is common, as remarked in the note, in Aramaic. The fair inference from this is, that the root-meaning of the Hebrew word is ‘to counsel,’ just as the root-meaning of the word Apostle is ‘one sent.’ These senses are just what the context requires. Koheleth turns round to see wisdom in comparison with, or contradistinction to, false hopes and false prudence, and asks how the man, that is, humanity, can tell the one from the other. His words are ‘what is,’ not ‘<i>who</i> is the man,’ <abbr
        title="and so forth">etc.</abbr>,
      equivalent to――‘in what way can humanity enter upon the results of the counsel,’ ‘or the king,’――the equivoke being, we believe, intentional, and the contracted relative giving a conditional turn to the sentence――‘with respect to that which at present he performs it.’ It would have been better if the word <b>with</b> had been printed in the notes with a small letter, as the division hardly amounts to a period, though the connexion is not close. The suffix of the verb refers back through the relative pronoun to counsel, and might be well rendered into English thus――‘In respect of which he at present takes that counsel.’ The <abbr
        title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>,
      contrary to their custom, omit <span
        class="grk" lang="grc">ἤδη</span>,
      because it is perhaps sufficiently included in <span
        class="grk" lang="grc">ἐπελεύσεται</span>, or because <span
        class="grk" lang="grc">τὰ ὅσα ἤδη ἐποίησαν αὐτήν</span>
      would not have been intelligible. It is evident this all squares with the context. Koheleth, as Solomon, discovered that with all his wisdom he could not practically discern the difference between this true wisdom and that false prudence which led him to accumulate only to be disappointed in his successor.</p>

        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">חוץ ממנו</span>,
      for clearly this makes good sense, and preserves the real meaning of <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">חוץ</span>,
      which has the signification of ‘without,’ ‘on the outside,’ Genesis <abbr
        title="chapter 6">vi.</abbr> 14, Deuteronomy <abbr
        title="chapter 25">xxv.</abbr> 5, references.)
      The phrase <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">ומי יחוש חוץ ממני</span>
      requires further elucidation. The reading <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">ממנו</span>,
      supported by the <abbr
        title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>,
      is also confirmed by Hebrew <abbr
        title="Manuscripts">MSS.</abbr>
      The literal rendering is――‘and who hastens outside him.’ This the <abbr
        title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr> translate <span
        class="grk" lang="grc">καὶ τίς πιέται πάρεξ αὐτοῦ</span>,

      There is a reading of <abbr
        title="Alexandrine Edition">A²</abbr>, <span
        class="grk" lang="grc">φείσεται</span>,
      ‘spares.’ The former is supported by Peshito, Arabic, and Theodotion――the latter by Aquila, Symmachus, and Jerome. If the Greek text alone had to be considered, <span
        class="grk" lang="grc">φείσεται</span>
      would, as the harder reading, be entitled to the preference. It is readily seen, however, that it arose from a conjectural alteration of the Hebrew text into <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">חוס</span>,
      for which there is no authority; neither will the meaning to ‘spare’ make any sense in the context. As the root occurs frequently, we are driven to the conclusion that the rendering of the <abbr
        title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
      was by design. Schleusner’s conjecture that <span
        class="grk" lang="grc">πίεται</span>
      is used in the signification of ‘sensibus frui,’ is no doubt correct――compare Habakkuk <abbr
        title="chapter 1">i.</abbr> 8, as also Isaiah <abbr
        title="chapter 28">xxviii.</abbr> 16. Considered as <i
        lang="la">ad sensum</i>,
      this rendering gives the idea of the Hebrew text correctly.</p>

      <abbr title="Roman numeral 3">III.</abbr> At this point Koheleth commences another line of argument; he notices that all things proceed according to a fixed and settled order of providence. This truth he brings into great prominence by instancing eight-and-twenty――a fourfold seven――different times or seasons existing in human life. From this he deduces the conclusion, that as it is impossible to alter the order of Providence, the toil of man is useless to effect any real good, so far as this world is concerned. The way in which this thought is worked out is peculiar. Koheleth is both sarcastic and paradoxical in his arguments; but his sarcasms are never ill-natured and his paradoxes promote thought. He also enlivens his subject with a considerable number of plays upon words, and striking and pregnant aphorisms.</p>

      is the construct of <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">דברה</span>,

        class="grk" lang="grc">περὶ λαλιᾶς</span>,

      considering that the root is <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">ברר</span>,
      which has the meaning ‘to sift,’ ‘purify by sifting,’ this is the only instance of the infinitive kal. Now we must take this meaning, observing that the pronoun ‘them,’ which is involved in the termination of the verb, is not emphatic; it is the discrimination of God which is the point, the persons on which this is exercised are subordinate. The Jewish commentators for the most part explain <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">לברם</span>
      as the third person singular preterite of <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">ברה</span>
      with the objective pronominal affix <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">ם</span>
      [the only instance, however, in which <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">ברה</span>
      has the meaning ‘to choose’ is 1 Samuel <abbr
        title="chapter 17">xvii.</abbr> 8];
      as, however, some copies read <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">לבררם</span>,
      we can have no difficulty in referring the word to the root <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">ברר</span>,
      which makes good sense. It is also to be remarked that though <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">ברם</span>
      does not exist as a root in Hebrew, it does so in Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic, and the meaning is that which is ‘twisted’ or ‘infolded’――compare Ezekiel <abbr
        title="chapter 27">xxvii.</abbr> 24――a
      ‘garment’ worked in many colours; this would make good sense also in this place, and may possibly have been an intentional equivoke, which is not surely improbable in a sentence in which such manifest artificial alliteration occurs. The meaning then is, that) <b>the Deity</b> (discriminates men, or makes a distinction between them and the lower creatures; but in what respects? This is discussed at length) <b>and to see</b> (but rather might this form of the infinitive be rendered, for which there is sufficient authority, ‘<i>to the appearance</i>’) <b>that they</b> (contract relative, and hence the meaning is that this appearance belongs to them, and them only. In this may be found the key to the whole passage. In appearance there is no choice or discrimination, as subsequent argument proves, because they are) <b>a cattle</b> (singular, following a plural, and thus giving the meaning that each one is so) <b>they to them</b> (which Mendelssohn explains, following the <abbr
        title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>,
      ‘when left to themselves,’ or, as we should say, as ‘far as they can tell.’ With this Ewald and Ginsburg agree, who consider this latter clause an ironical ‘<i
        lang="la">ipsissimi</i>,’――‘they
      themselves, indeed!’ Thus, then, the meaning of the whole passage is, ‘I said, yes, I did in my heart again, so far as human reasonings extend concerning any discrimination the Divine Providence has made of them, and as far as appearances go with them, a mere animal is each one of them, so far as they can tell.’ The sentence is very sarcastic and equivocal, as the alliteration at the end
      <a id="b027"></a>shows. Then, again, if we take the root <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">ברם</span>
      in the sense of ‘web,’ as we use it for something intricate, in that case we should have the equivoke, ‘concerning the web of Divine Providence so far as it appears to them.’ Again, also, the Syriac renders as if <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">לברם</span> were <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">לבראם</span>,
      ‘their Creator,’ which also makes excellent sense; but this, again, may simply be a rendering of another equivoke. Then, again, there is a possible play between <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">בהמה</span>
      and the same word considered as <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">המה</span>
      with the preposition――all these equivokes assist the sense). Consistent with this is what follows:――</p>

  </div>
  <div class="flt_rt parabrk">
    <p class="in_00">
      Thus I perceived that there can be no real good above that present-pleasure which man can obtain from his work; as that is what belongs to him: for who can bring him to see what may be the subsequent results?</p>

  <hr class="flt_clr noshow">

      <a id="b028"></a>‘more than that in which,’ or ‘above that he should’) <b>he rejoices</b>, even <b>the man</b> does (humanity generally), <b>in his workings</b> (or what he accomplishes, plural), <b>for</b> (or, as <span

Thus Koheleth’s reasoning is quite clear, conclusive, and connected. In <i>ten</i> particulars man and beast are alike. (1.) The result is the same to both; (2.) their death is alike; (3.) their spirit or animal life is the same; (4.) there is no pre-eminence of the one over the other; (5.) they are alike evanescent; (6.) they all go to the same place; (7.) they come from the same dust; (8.) and they all go to the same dust, and no one can tell (<abbr
        title="that is"><i>i.e.</i></abbr>
      for certain, or by ordinary observations) that they differ in this; (9.) man’s soul goes up, (10.) and the beast’s goes down. The arrangement of the whole, it will be seen, is highly artificial.</p>
    <p>
      The next stage in the argument opens with ‘I turned and saw.’ That is a further observation of a point in which, it may be remarked incidentally, man does differ from the beast: he is the only animal that weeps. The object here is again to show that mere earthly labour, as such, produces no satisfaction. At this point the argument becomes somewhat less sustained, dealing rather with a succession of instances.</p>

Koheleth’s observation has regard to the progress of lives in relation to anything that may or is to be produced by them in the way of heritage――or, in other words, he asks how far
      <a id="b034"></a>the present state of things can be explained on the theory that it is a working for posterity, and he shows that this is not an explanation, for there is no result obtained by the collective people in the present, because each age is the same morally as that which went before it; while, of course, with regard to what is to succeed, the present generation cannot rejoice in that, because they will be all dead, and as the argument is limited to what takes place under the sun, so all so-called progress is but an instance of evanescence. The idea, if not that contained in the observation of one who selfishly observed, when requested to care for posterity, ‘that as posterity had done nothing for him, he did not see why he should do anything for posterity,’ rests on the same facts.</p>

      not in the past. The deepest sorrows fade away quickly into forgetfulness; and so also the brightest joys. They have, no doubt, some influence by recollection, but not <i>much</i>. And thus the Deity, or God regarded as the supreme providential ruler, exercises us. He responds to our anxieties, afflicts us, or chastens us, or causes us pleasure by means of joys given or taken away, as the case may be. Again, these are spoken of as joys of our <i>hearts</i>, or of our inward desires and consciousness, which is the meaning of ‘heart’ in this book; our <i>emotional nature</i>, as the idea would stand expressed in the nomenclature of modern philosophy.</p>

Thus we obtain a connected sense. The anxiety is for enjoyment, but satisfaction is impossible. What, then, is the advantage or profit of wisdom, in the sense of knowing what is best to do under a given set of circumstances? and what advantage gives it over the man who is dissatisfied equally, but does <i>not</i> know this?

      <a id="b053"></a>if we follow the Masorets, who point <span

    <p>
      Were it not for this suspicious <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">אַתָּ</span>
      there would be no reason at all to disturb the present Hebrew text. Nor, probably, is the evidence strong against it, unless indeed it should turn out, on further investigation and discovery, that when the version of the <abbr
        title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
      was made, there was a greater difference between the letters <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">͏͏ר</span> and <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">ד</span>
      than there is now. If the reading of the <abbr
        title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
      were right, the following was the meaning of the passage:――‘Moreover, to all the words which they speak [they being supposed to refer to the wicked, hence the explanatory gloss of B, <span
        class="grk" lang="grc">ἀσεβεῖς</span>],
      do not give thine heart,’――which [amounts to this]――‘thou wouldest not hear (or listen to) with respect to thy servant cursing thee, because many times he vexes thy heart, which [amounts to this also] in regard that thou hast <i>cursed</i> others.’ The innuendo being that our reasonings with regard to God’s dealings with ourselves are like the rash improper speeches of a grumbling servant. It must be confessed that the expression, <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">אשר גם את קללת</span>,
      literally, ‘which also with respect to thou hast cursed,’ is unprecedentedly harsh and elliptical, even for Koheleth. But to alter the text――and the Masoretic punctuation is here a virtual alteration of the text――is to interpret an imaginary document, and not the one which exists before our eyes. The Masorets, however, with their customary caution――and in this respect they are a brilliant example to some modern critics――would not add a single letter, on mere conjecture only, however plausible.</p>

      the object he has in his labour, is to find out some method by which he may rectify what appears wrong in the course of God’s providence: in the strict sense of the term this is impossible. The principle which pervades Koheleth’s reasoning is, that enjoyment, as such, is God’s gift, and that toil is useless. Labour, however, which is distinguished from toil, is to be done in the fear of God, and the result left to his providence. The argument which is to follow further enforces this.</p>

            src="images/i_b073k.png"></span>――‘If
      the axe be blunt, and it troubles the face and increases the slain; and the advantage of the diligent is wisdom.’ The Vulgate reads――‘<span
        lang="la">Si retusam fuerit ferrum <i>et hoc non ut prius</i> sed hebetatum fuerit, multo labore <a
          id="b073a" href="#n_59">♦</a>exacuetur
        et post industriam <a
          id="b073b" href="#n_60">♠</a>sequetur
        sapientia</span>’――‘If
      the iron should be blunt, and this <i>not as before</i>, but should have lost its edge, it is sharpened with much labour; and after industry will follow wisdom.’ Jerome renders the former part in conformity with the Vulgate; but after ‘<i
        lang="la">non ut prius</i>,’
      which he also has, runs on with――‘<span
        lang="la">sed conturbatum fuerit, virtutibus corroborabitur, et reliquum fortitudinis sapientia est ...</span>’――‘but
      is troubled; it shall be strengthened by virtues, and the remainder of strength is wisdom.’ It will be seen then that we have reason to suspect a corruption of the text; and we think that the suspicious ‘<span
        lang="la">non ut prius</span>’
      of the Vulgate and Jerome shows what this corruption was. We notice also that neither the <abbr
        title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
      nor the Syriac take any notice of the negative. Guided by the clue thus given, we will venture on the following conjectural emendation of the text. We imagine that it was originally written thus, <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">והוא להפנים קלקל</span>,
      the <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">ה</span>
      being written full――like <a
      id="b073c" href="#n_93">♣</a><span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">שתקיף</span> in chapter <abbr
        title="6">vi.</abbr> 10, compare also chapter <abbr
        title="8">viii.</abbr> 1, Nehemiah <abbr
        title="chapter 9">ix.</abbr> 19――and
      having the meaning, ‘to <i>the</i> faces’ or ‘edges.’ Such an insertion of <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">ה</span>
      being unusual, would cause suspicion to rest on the passage, and the transition to <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">לא פנים</span>
      would be easy. This, however, was but one out of many possible conjectures, and the Vulgate has preserved
      <a id="b074"></a>another, namely, that the reading was <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">לפני</span>,
      ‘as before,’ and, as was common with the ancient versions, inserts both the reading and its variant into the text. This conjectural change in the text will make all quite clear; the passage will then read thus――‘If the iron be blunt, and so it is as to its edges whetted, and so too blows prevail, and so too an advantage is the success [due to an instance] of wisdom,’ <abbr
        title="that is"><i>i.e.</i></abbr>
      in this case a skilful hit. That is, if the axe be blunt, grinding, force, and skill together, will produce the required result. No doubt this can only be put forth as mere conjecture, but, in the absence of any satisfactory interpretation, may be admitted; for, in fact, arbitrary senses given to words, and the insertions of explanatory glosses not immediately deducible from the original, do amount to alterations of the text. None of the other ancient Greek versions have been preserved in this place, except a reading of Symmachus, which is very curious, showing still more forcibly how early the difficulty must have arisen, since it is at best a reading <i
        lang="la">ad sensum</i> only, <span
        class="grk" lang="grc">προέχει δὲ ὁ γοργευσάμενος εἰς σοφίαν</span>,

The meaning of the passage is――‘That the elaborate fool multiplies reasonings, which are sure to have an evil tendency, as they are intended to promote his elaborate folly, although man generally neither understands the meaning of the present, nor can divine the future.’ The difficulty of the sentence arises from the play between <span

      There is however, we suspect, a perceptible difference in the meaning in these cases.

      shows how they understood it, and so also the Syriac and Vulgate. The whole sentence is ironical, when the tree has really fallen, then we know which way it fell. The Masoretic accentuation of this passage is peculiar――we should naturally have expected them to have divided the verse into two clauses, at <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">יריקו</span>,
      ‘they empty,’ instead of which the greatest pause occurs at ‘north’ <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">בַּצָּפ֑וֹן</span>,
      but this method of reading renders the irony of the passage; the verse will then stand thus:――‘If the clouds are full of rain they will empty themselves upon the earth, and so if the tree should incline to the south, or if it should incline to the north――the place where it falls is where it really will <i>be</i>.’ The accentuation is rhetorical rather than logical, and the Masorets have shown great taste in their pointing).</p>

      also from the height they fear, and shall be terrified in the way, and the watch shall rush upon him, and the almond flourish, and the grasshopper be increased, and the caper shall burst, and desire shall cease.’ We think that, with these different versions before us, all of which have preserved portions of the original, we shall be able to conjecture the meaning of the text. It is just possible that originally the text read <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">מגביה</span>,
      and which might have been altered by displacing the <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">י</span>,
      and putting it on to the beginning of the next word; for otherwise it is hard to suppose that the <abbr
        title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
      would go out of their way to alter a reading the meaning of which, as it stands, is so obvious. <abbr
        title="Vatican text">B.</abbr>
      seems to have preserved this original reading. The difference to the sense, however, is not great, as this looking upwards is evidently the effect of fear, as is shown by the next clause. This begins with the word <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">וחתחתים</span>――a
      reduplicated and therefore emphasized form of <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">חתת</span>,
      to ‘be dismayed,’ or ‘distracted,’ as in the sense of ‘broken in pieces;’ hence the rendering of Aquila: ‘These intense tremblings in the way’――which word ‘way’ surely we may interpret in the ethical sense so common in this book of ‘way of life’――are the natural result of ‘looking with fearfulness into the height.’ Compare chapter <abbr
        title="3">iii.</abbr> 21.</p>
    <footer>
      <div class="tnote" id="n_84">
        <p class="first">
          <a href="#b082a">♦</a>
          “<span class="grk" lang="grc">πανχυνθῆ</span>” replaced with “<span class="grk" lang="grc">παχυνθῇ</span>”</p>
      </div></footer>
    <p>
      The next clause is still more obscure. The word <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">ינאץ</span>
      has, in all other places,
      <a id="b083"></a>the meaning ‘to be despised,’ or, in piel, to ‘provoke.’ The hiphil occurs here only, and is rendered, contrary to all analogy, ‘flourish.’ This is virtually to alter the text; and though the <abbr
        title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
      support this rendering, it is clear, from its various readings, that the Greek text has also been tampered with. The original meaning has apparently been preserved by Symmachus, and by the alternative rendering of the Syriac. Then as to ‘the almond tree,’ <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">השקד</span>:
      the word occurs Genesis <abbr
        title="chapter 43">xliii.</abbr> 11, Numbers <abbr
        title="chapter 17">xvii.</abbr> 8 (23), Jeremiah <abbr
        title="chapter 1">i.</abbr> 11,
      <i>all</i>. This last passage gives probably the clue. The almond is the first tree to blossom in the coming spring, and is its harbinger; it is, as it were, in a hurry to welcome it; but this harbinger of spring is despised. As to the interpretation that the almond blossom is an allegorical description of the white hairs of an old man, it may be answered that the almond blossom is pink, not white.</p>
    <p>
      The next clause――‘The grasshopper shall be a burden’――may be explained by noticing that the word <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">חגב</span>
      occurs Numbers <abbr
        title="chapter 13">xiii.</abbr> 33, Isaiah <abbr
        title="chapter 40">xl.</abbr> 22,
      as the type of something small or insignificant. The only other two places, <abbr
        title="in particular">viz.</abbr> Leviticus <abbr
        title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr> 22, 2 Chronicles <abbr
        title="chapter 7">vii.</abbr> 13,
      where the word occurs, show that this creature was edible, but might become a plague. <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">יסתבל</span>,
      the hithpael of <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">סבל</span>,
      occurs here only; ‘burdens itself’ is the exact meaning. The English Version no doubt gives here the true sense.</p>
    <p>
      The next clause――‘Desire shall fail’――may be explained in the same way. The word <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">תפר</span>,
      the hiphil of <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">פרר</span>,
      has always the meaning to ‘break,’ ‘disannul’――see Numbers <abbr
        title="chapter 30">xxx.</abbr> 13, Job <abbr
        title="chapter 15">xv.</abbr> 4, and hophal, Zechariah <abbr
        title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr> 11.
      Evidently Symmachus, with the reading <span
        class="grk" lang="grc">διαλυθῇ ἡ ἐπίπονος</span>,
      has preserved the true meaning; for by <span
        class="grk" lang="grc">ἐπίπονος</span>
      he has rendered the word <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">אביונה</span>,
      which occurs here only. Now we have no right to seek a strange signification for this word when fair sense can be made according to the ordinary derivations. <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">אביון</span>
      occurs frequently in the sense of ‘a poor person’――the root being <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">אבה</span>,
      ‘to wish,’ or ‘desire.’ Jerome translates, as we see――‘<span
        lang="la">Et dissolvetur spiritus fortitudinis</span>’――‘the
      spirit or breath of the brave is dissolved,’ which is <i
        lang="la">ad sensum</i>; so that we may take <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">אביונה</span>
      as simply an abstract of <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">אביון</span>,
      with the meaning of ‘wishfulness,’ or ‘longing.’ Thus the reading of the <abbr
        title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
      is explained: Capers are provocatives of desire or appetite, and hence their Hebrew name. The <span
        class="grk" lang="grc">ἐπίπονος</span>
      of Symmachus occurs only once again, at Isaiah <abbr
        title="chapter 53">liii.</abbr> 3,
      where it represents the Hebrew <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">מכאבות</span>,
      ‘griefs’ (see Field’s most instructive note, Hexaplar <i>in loc.</i>). Thus we venture to offer the following as a probable explanation of this passage:――‘Besides, they look with dread on high, and great dismay is in the way, and the almond tree (as a symbol of anticipation) is despised, and the grasshopper (as a symbol of what is small and light) is burdensome, and the caper-berries (as the symbol of desires or longings) are scattered.’ In the last clause the metaphorical out-tops the literal meaning, as the Authorized Version renders, rightly abandoning the <abbr
        title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
      at this point.) <b>For</b> (or ‘so’) <b>advances</b> (<span

    <p>
      We must notice, in interpreting these last verses that the acts described are all such as take time, indeed but a short time, to accomplish, and occur frequently. The string of the lamp will be loosed almost
      <a id="b085"></a>daily, and the lamp taken away; and surely no more poetical or impressive metaphor of death can be discovered than a lamp with oil-bowl gone. Next we have the shattered pitcher――an accident which may happen at any time; and then the bucket running down into the well, which is a comparatively frequent occurrence, and may well bring vividly before our minds the disappearance of one who was just before familiarly among us. That the bucket might be drawn up again full of living water is necessarily not mentioned, but is one of those hidden sarcastic promises in which the book delights. The last two clauses are joined together by the simple ‘and;’ but there is clearly at this point a transition from simile to metaphor, which the Authorized Version notices. If indeed one likes to take it so, the simile is true enough of dust and wind, but the last clause discloses a deeper meaning. After all, the promises of a resurrection are but scarcely hidden behind the apparent hopelessness of the conclusion arrived at.</p>
    <p>
      The interpretation which makes the whole of this passage a metaphorical description of old age, comes from no more authoritative source than Hagadic interpretation, as embodied in the Chaldee Targum. There is no proof that any allegory was intended, and the literal meaning is not only to the purpose, but exceedingly touching and beautiful. The arrangement of clauses, also, is highly artificial, which may be seen by counting them as marked off by the recurring forms ‘or ever,’ ‘also,’ and the like.</p>

        href="#b033a">chapter <abbr title="4">iv.</abbr> 16</a>,

        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">י</span> into van <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">ו</span>,
      the rendering of the <abbr
        title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
      would become unintelligible, and hence the variations, especially that of <abbr
        title="Editio Aldina, 1518">E.</abbr> Then <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">אזן</span>,
      which is really nominative to <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">יחקר</span>,
      and emphatic as standing before it, came to be regarded as a verb and pointed piel, the only instance of such pointing that occurs, and then accenting <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">וְחִקֵּ֔ר</span>
      with zakeph, the Masorets made these two words a parenthesis, and pointed <span

      as a piel pret., instead of a noun as do the <abbr
        title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>; they then make <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">הרבה</span>
      singular agree with the plural <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">משלים</span>,
      which would, according to the usage of this book, be distributive. On the whole, however, it seems very probable that the <abbr
        title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
      have preserved the right reading, or at least the meaning of the passage; this meaning is, ‘and for the rest, because Koheleth <i>was</i> a wise man, still he taught knowledge with respect to the people, and his ear [<abbr
        title="that is"><i>i.e.</i></abbr>
      judgment, for the word contains the idea of weighing as in a balance] was seeking out an orderly meaning [or solution] of parables;’ by parables he means doubtless the mysterious facts cited. The next verse takes this thought up thus: ‘Very much sought Koheleth in order to find words of providence――and written correctly words of truth.’ If the reading were really <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">וכתוב</span>,
      and not, as we may conjecture, <span

      This word has a curious history, which will further
      <a id="b087"></a>illustrate its meaning at this place. The reading of the Hexapla at Isaiah <abbr
        title="chapter 24">xxiv.</abbr> 22 is: <span
        class="grk" lang="grc">
          Οʹ. καὶ συνάξουσι ※ συναγωγὴν αὐτῆς ※ εἰς δεσμωτήριον καὶ ἀποκλείσουσιν εἰς ὀχύρωμα. Σ. καὶ ἀθροισθήσονται ἀθροισμὸν δεσμίου καὶ συγκλεισθήσονται εἰς συγκλεισμόν</span>,
      showing a difficulty about the word which in the Hexapla is included between <a

      hence they understood the allusion to be to the stake set across the entrance of the fold to prevent the cattle from straying out. That this reading will explain Isaiah <abbr
        title="chapter 24">xxiv.</abbr> 22
      is evident enough, and that it will explain this passage also will be seen if we look upon these goads as both compelling the oxen to labour, and, as the Syriac renders, forming the stakes which close the entrance to the lair); <b>are given from a shepherd, one only</b> (notice that <span
        class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">אחד</span>
      stands emphatically at the end of the sentence, and must mean, therefore, ‘the shepherd, who is the only one.’ This verse has greatly perplexed commentators: a diligent perusal of the ancient versions, and following the hint given by the Syriac above, will show us what is the real meaning.

The meaning of the passage will be: ‘These words of wise men are like goads, by which the ox is incited to labour, but then they are like stakes [<abbr
        title="that is"><i>i.e.</i></abbr>
      to which the ox may be tied, or, of which a fence might be made to confine him] as well, planted around the persons brought together, [or the herd, and so infixed as masters of the assembly]; they are given from the shepherd [or herdsman’――for the word has both senses]――‘who is the only one;’ or, since <span

    Page 9, <span class="smcap">Notes</span>. <i>At end of Note on verse 17, after</i> ‘spirit,’ <i>add</i>: It may be observed that <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">רעיון</span>
    occurs in the Chaldee of Daniel――see Daniel <abbr
      title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr> 29, 30; <abbr

      title="chapter 5">v.</abbr> 6, <abbr
      title="and so forth">etc.</abbr>,
    always in the sense of a ‘<i>painful</i> reflection,’ but in later Chaldee and Syriac as ‘a reflection’ of any kind. As the sense in which Koheleth uses the word is the nearest to the root-meaning, is it not an evidence, so far, of earlier composition of his book?</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    Page 12, <span class="smcap">Notes</span>. <i>At end of Note on verse 5 add</i>: It should have been mentioned that <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">פרדס</span>
    is also considered to afford an indication of late composition. It is said to be a Persian word; it occurs, however, Nehemiah <abbr
      title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr> 8; <abbr
      title="Canticles or Song of Solomon">Canticles</abbr> <abbr
      title="chapter 4">iv.</abbr> 10.
    The word admits of Semitic derivation, from <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">פרד</span>,
    ‘to divide,’ ‘cut off in portions,’ ‘lay out.’ If it be really an exotic, no date of introduction is more probable than that of Solomon. It is also to be noted that in the context it <i>follows</i> the word ‘gardens,’ which is quite natural if it were intended to denote a foreign luxury recently introduced.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    Page 15, <span class="smcap">Notes</span>. <i>At end of Note on verse 12 add</i>: This most obscure passage may perhaps receive some light from a further discussion of the word <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">כבר</span>
    and other forms derived from the same root. The feminine or abstract occurs Genesis <abbr
      title="chapter 35">xxxv.</abbr> 16, <abbr
      title="chapter 48">xlviii.</abbr> 7, and 2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 5">v.</abbr> 19, joined with <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">ארץ</span>,
    rendered in the Authorized Version a ‘little’ way. The verb occurs in hiphil, Job <abbr
      title="chapter 35">xxxv.</abbr> 16, <abbr
      title="chapter 36">xxxvi.</abbr> 31,
    translated ‘multiplied,’ ‘in abundance;’ and in the hiphil form, with the characteristic <i>jud̄</i> inserted――Job <abbr
      title="chapter 8">viii.</abbr> 2, <abbr
      title="chapter 15">xv.</abbr> 10, <abbr
      title="and so forth">etc.</abbr>; Isaiah <abbr
      title="chapter 10">x.</abbr> 13, <abbr
      title="chapter 17">xvii.</abbr> 12, <abbr
      title="and so forth">etc.</abbr>――in
    the sense of ‘full of years,’ ‘overflowing,’ and the like. A diligent comparison of these meanings shows that ‘fulness,’ in the sense of ‘completeness,’ must be the root-meaning; and hence, when applied to time, the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr> render <span
      class="grk" lang="grc">ἤδη</span>,
    ‘already.’ With this meaning agree also the Arabic and Syriac, see Fuerst, Lexicon, <abbr
      title="under the word"><i>s. voc</i></abbr>.
    The meaning then of the word is, the ‘<i>complete</i> present.’ With regard to the use of the root <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">מלך</span>
    in the sense of counsel, it occurs once in Hebrew, <abbr
      title="in particular">viz.</abbr> Nehemiah <abbr
      title="chapter 5">v.</abbr> 7,
    and once in biblical Chaldee, Daniel <abbr
      title="chapter 4">iv.</abbr> 27 (24).
    This meaning is common, as remarked in the note, in Aramaic. The fair inference from this is, that the root-meaning of the Hebrew word is ‘to counsel,’ just as the root-meaning of the word Apostle is ‘one sent.’ These senses are just what the context requires. Koheleth turns round to see wisdom in comparison with, or contradistinction to, false hopes and false prudence, and asks how the man, that is, humanity, can tell the one from the other. His words are ‘what is,’ not ‘<i>who</i> is the man,’ <abbr
      title="and so forth">etc.</abbr>,
    equivalent to――‘in what way can humanity enter upon the results of the counsel,’ ‘or the king,’――the equivoke being, we believe, intentional, and the contracted relative giving a conditional turn to the sentence――‘with respect to that which at present he performs it.’ It would have been better if the word <b>with</b> had been printed in the notes with a small letter, as the division hardly amounts to a period, though the connexion is not close. The suffix of the verb refers back through the relative pronoun to counsel, and might be well rendered into English thus――‘In respect of which he at present takes that counsel.’ The <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>,
    contrary to their custom, omit <span
      class="grk" lang="grc">ἤδη</span>,
    because it is perhaps sufficiently included in <span
      class="grk" lang="grc">ἐπελεύσεται</span>,
    <a id="b092"></a>or because <span
      class="grk" lang="grc">τὰ ὅσα ἤδη ἐποίησαν αὐτήν</span>
    would not have been intelligible. It is evident this all squares with the context. Koheleth, as Solomon, discovered that with all his wisdom he could not practically discern the difference between this true wisdom and that false prudence which led him to accumulate only to be disappointed in his successor.</p>

    Page 19, <span class="smcap">Notes</span>. <i>At end of Note on verse 25 add</i>: The phrase <span

    requires further elucidation. The reading <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">ממנו</span>,
    supported by the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>,
    is also confirmed by Hebrew <abbr
      title="Manuscripts">MSS.</abbr>
    The literal rendering is――‘and who hastens outside him.’ This the <abbr

    There is a reading of <abbr
      title="Alexandrine Edition">A²</abbr>, <span
      class="grk" lang="grc">φείσεται</span>,
    ‘spares.’ The former is supported by Peshito, Arabic, and Theodotion――the latter by Aquila, Symmachus, and Jerome. If the Greek text alone had to be considered, <span
      class="grk" lang="grc">φείσεται</span>
    would, as the harder reading, be entitled to the preference. It is readily seen, however, that it arose from a conjectural alteration of the Hebrew text into <span
      class="hbrw" dir="rtl" lang="hbo">חוס</span>,
    for which there is no authority; neither will the meaning to ‘spare’ make any sense in the context. As the root occurs frequently, we are driven to the conclusion that the rendering of the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    was by design. Schleusner’s conjecture that <span
      class="grk" lang="grc">πίεται</span>
    is used in the signification of ‘sensibus frui,’ is no doubt correct――compare Habakkuk <abbr
      title="chapter 1">i.</abbr> 8, as also Isaiah <abbr
      title="chapter 28">xxviii.</abbr> 16. Considered as <i
      lang="la">ad sensum</i>,
    this rendering gives the idea of the Hebrew text correctly.</p>

    “<i>It is easy to see that Henri Perreyve, Professor of Moral Theology at the Sorbonne, was a Roman Catholic priest of no ordinary type. With comparatively little of what Protestants call superstition, with great courage and sincerity, with a nature singularly guileless and noble, his priestly vocation, although pursued, according to his biographer, with unbridled zeal, did not stifle his human sympathies and aspirations. He could not believe that his faith compelled him ‘to renounce sense and reason,’ or that a priest was not free to speak, act, and think like other men. Indeed, the Abbé Gratry makes a kind of apology for his friend’s free-speaking in this respect, and endeavours to explain it. Perreyve was the beloved disciple of Lacordaire, who left him all his manuscripts, notes, and papers, and he himself attained the position of a great pulpit orator.</i>”――<span

    “<i>And it is in itself a true work of art, a whole finely conceived, and carried out with sustained power,—one of those reproductions and adumbrations of great works, in which mere servile copying disappears, and which are only possible to a mind which, however inferior to its original, is yet of the same order and temperament, with an unusual faculty for taking the impressions of that original and reflecting them undimmed. It is much to say of a volume like this. But it is not too much to say, when, after going through it, we consider the thorough knowledge of the subject shown in it, the patient skill with which the intricate and puzzling arrangements of the poem, full of what we call the conceits and puzzles of the contemporary philosophy, are unravelled and made intelligible; the discrimination and high principle with which so ardent a lover of the great poet blames his excesses; the high and noble Christian faith which responds to his; and, lastly, the gift of eloquent speech, keen, rich, condensed, expressive, which seems to have passed into the writer from the loving study of the greatest master in his own tongue of all the inimitable harmonies of language—the tenderest, the deepest, the most awful.</i>”—<span

We find the volume furnished with useful diagrams of the Dantesque universe, of Hell, Purgatory, and the ‘Rose of the Blessed,’ and adorned with a beautiful group of the likenesses of the poet, and with symbolic figures (on the binding) in which the taste and execution of <abbr

The result has been a book which is not only delightful in itself to read, but is admirably adapted as an encouragement to those students who wish to obtain a preliminary survey of the land before they attempt to follow Dante through his long and arduous pilgrimage.

We know of no more suitable manual for the newly confirmed, and nothing more likely to engage the sympathies of youthful hearts.

    “<i>A profound and learned treatise, evidently the work of one of the first theologians of the day, discussing with the scientific fulness and precision proper to German investigation, the great doctrinal questions expected to come before the Council, and especially the proposed dogma of Papal Infallibility. There is probably no work in existence that contains at all, still less within so narrow a compass, so complete a record of the origin and growth of the infallibilist theory, and of all the facts of Church history bearing upon it, and that too in a form so clear and concise as to put the argument within the reach of any reader of ordinary intelligence, while the scrupulous accuracy of the writer, and his constant reference to the original authorities for every statement liable to be disputed, makes the monograph as a whole a perfect storehouse of valuable information for the historical or theological student.</i>”—<span

  <p class="txt_sm">
    “<i>Beginning with a sketch of the errors and contradictions of the Popes, and of the position which, as a matter of history, they held in the early Church, the book proceeds to describe the three great forgeries by which the Papal claims were upheld—the Isidorian decretals, the donation of Constantine, and the decretum of Gratian. The last subject ought to be carefully studied by all who wish to understand the frightful tyranny of a complicated system of laws, devised not for the protection of a people, but as instruments for grinding them to subjection. Then, after an historical outline of the general growth of the Papal power in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the writers enter upon the peculiarly episcopal and clerical question, pointing out how marvellously every little change worked in one direction, invariably tending to throw the rule of the Church into the power of Rome; and how the growth of new institutions, like the monastic orders and the Inquisition, gradually withdrew the conduct of affairs from the Bishops of the Church in general, and consolidated the Papal influence. For all this, however, unless we could satisfy ourselves with a mere magnified table of contents the reader must be referred to the book itself, in which he will find the interest sustained without flagging to the end.</i>”—<span

    “<i>In France, in Holland, and in Germany, there has already appeared a multitude of disquisitions on this subject. Among these several are the acknowledged compositions of men of high standing in the Roman Catholic world,—men admittedly entitled to speak with the authority that must attach to established reputation: but not one of them has hitherto produced a work more likely to create a deep impression than the anonymous German publication at the head of this notice. It is not a piece of merely polemical writing, it is a treatise dealing with a large subject in an impressive though partisan manner, a treatise grave in tone, solid in matter, and bristling with forcible and novel illustrations.</i>”—<span

    “<i>Rumour will, no doubt, be busy with its conjectures as to the name which lurks beneath the nom de plume of ‘Janus.’ We do not intend to offer any contribution towards the elucidation of the mystery unless it be a contribution to say that the book bears internal evidence of being the work of a Catholic, and that there are not many Catholics in Europe who could have written it. Taking it all in all, it is no exaggerated praise to characterise it as the most damaging assault on Ultra-montanism that has appeared in modern times. Its learning is copious and complete, yet so admirably arranged that it invariably illustrates without overlaying the argument. The style is clear and simple, and there is no attempt at rhetoric. It is a piece of cool and masterly dissection, all the more terrible for the passionless manner in which the author conducts the operation.</i>”—<span

    1. <span class="smcap">Nature of the Work.</span> This Dictionary consists of a series of original Essays (alphabetically arranged, and 575 in number) on all the principal subjects connected with the Doctrines of the Christian Church. Some idea of the subjects, and of the length of the articles, may be formed from the following titles of those which occupy the work from page 700 to page 720.</p>

      Supremacy, Papal.</span></p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    2. <span class="smcap">Object of the Work.</span> The writers of all the Essays have endeavoured to make them sufficiently exhaustive to render it unnecessary for the majority of readers to go further for information, and, at the same time, sufficiently suggestive of more recondite sources of Theological study, to help the student in following up his subjects. By means of a Table prefixed to the Dictionary, a regular course of such study may be carried out in its pages.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    3. <span class="smcap">Principles of the Work.</span> The Editor and his coadjutors have carefully avoided any party bias, and consequently the work cannot be said to be either “High Church,” “Low Church,” or “Broad Church.” The only bias of the Dictionary is that given by Revelation, History, Logic, and the literary idiosyncrasy of each particular contributor. But the Editor has not attempted to assist the circulation of the book by making it colourless on the pretence of impartiality.

    4. <span class="smcap">Part of a Series.</span> The Dictionary of Theology is complete in itself, but it is also intended to form part of a Series, entitled, “A Summary of Theology,” of which the second volume, “A Dictionary of Sects, Heresies, and Schools of Thought,” is in the press.</p>
  <p class="quobrk txt_sm">
    “<i>Taken as a whole the articles are the work of practised writers, and well informed and solid theologians.... We know no book of its size and bulk which supplies the information here given at all; far less which supplies it in an arrangement so accessible, with a completeness of information so thorough, and with an ability in the treatment of profound subjects so great. <abbr
      title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr>
    Hook’s most useful volume is a work of high calibre, but it is the work of a single mind. We have here a wider range of thought from a greater variety of sides. We have here also the work of men who evidently know what they write about and are somewhat more profound (to say the least), than the writers of the current Dictionaries of Sects and Heresies.</i>”—<span
      class="smcap">Guardian.</span></p>
  <p class="txt_sm">
    “<i>Mere antiquarianism, however interesting, has little place in it. But for all practical
    <a id="c025"></a>purposes its historical articles are excellent. They are of course, and of necessity, a good deal condensed, yet they are wonderfully complete; see for example such articles as ‘Atheism,’ ‘Cabbala,’ ‘Calvinism,’ ‘Canonization,’ ‘Convocations,’ ‘Evangelical,’ ‘Fathers,’ ‘Infant Baptism,’ <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    But the strength of the book lies in the theology proper, and herein more particularly in what one may call the metaphysical side of doctrine:—see the articles on ‘Conceptualism,’ ‘Doubt,’ ‘Dualism,’ ‘Election,’ ‘Eternity,’ ‘Everlasting Punishment,’ ‘Fatalism,’ and the like. We mention these as characteristic of the book. At the same time other more practical matters are fully dealt with. There are excellent and elaborate papers on such words as ‘Eucharist,’ ‘Confession,’ ‘Blood,’ ‘Cross,’ ‘Antichrist,’ to say nothing of the host of minor matters on which it is most convenient to be able to turn to a book which gives you at a glance the pith of a whole library in a column or a page. Thus it will be obvious that it takes a very much wider range than any undertaking of the same kind in our language; and that to those of our clergy who have not the fortune to spend in books, and would not have the leisure to use them if they possessed them, it will be the most serviceable and reliable substitute for a large library we can think of. And in many cases, while keeping strictly within its province as a Dictionary, it contrives to be marvellously suggestive of thought
    and reflections, which a serious minded man will take with him and ponder over for his own elaboration and future use. As an example of this we may refer to the whole article on Doubt. It is treated of under the successive heads of,—(1) its nature; (2) its origin; (3) the history of the principal periods of Doubt; (4) the consciousness—or actual experience of Doubt, and how to deal with its different phases and kinds; (5) the relations of Doubt to action and to belief. To explain a little we will here quote a paragraph or two, which may not be unacceptable to our readers.... The variety of the references given in the course of this article, and at its conclusion, show how carefully the writer has thought out and studied his subject in its various manifestations in many various minds, and illustrate very forcibly how much reading goes to a very small amount of space in anything worth the name of ‘Dictionary of Theology.’ We trust most sincerely that the book may be largely used. For a present to a clergyman on his ordination, or from a parishioner to his pastor, it would be most appropriate. It may indeed be called ‘a box of tools for a working clergyman.’</i>”—<span

    “<i>Seldom has an English work of equal magnitude been so permeated with Catholic instincts, and at the same time seldom has a work on theology been kept so free from the drift of rhetorical incrustation. Of course it is not meant that all these remarks apply in their full extent to every article. In a great Dictionary there are compositions, as in a great house there are vessels, of various kinds. Some of these at a future day may be replaced by others more substantial in their build, more proportionate in their outline, and more elaborate in their detail. But admitting all this, the whole remains a home to which the student will constantly recur, sure to find spacious chambers, substantial furniture, and (which is most important) no stinted light.</i>”—<span

    “<i>The second and final instalment of <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    Blunt’s useful Dictionary, itself but a part of a more comprehensive plan, is now before the public, and fully sustains the mainly favourable impression created by the appearance of the first part. Within the sphere it has marked out for itself, no equally useful book of reference exists in English for the elucidation of theological problems.... Entries which display much care, research, and judgment in compilation, and which will make the task of the parish priest who is brought face to face with any of the practical questions which they involve far easier than has been hitherto. The very fact that the utterances are here and there somewhat more guarded and hesitating than quite accords with our judgment, is a gain in so far as it protects the work from the charge of inculcating extreme views, and will thus secure its admission in many places where moderation is accounted the crowning grace.</i>”—<span

Accurate and succinct in statement, it may safely be trusted as a handbook as regards facts, while in our judgment, this second part still maintains the character we gave the first, namely, of showing most ability in its way of treating the more abstract and metaphysical side of theological questions. The liturgical articles also in this part deserve especial mention. The book is sure to make its own way by sheer force of usefulness.</i>”—<span

    Blunt’s Dictionary is a most acceptable addition to English theological literature. Its general style is terse and vigorous. Whilst its pages are free from wordiness, there is none of that undue condensation which, under the plea of judicious brevity, veils a mere empty jotting down of familiar statements (and mis-statements), at second or, it may be, third hand from existing works. Dean Hook’s well-known Dictionary makes the nearest approach to the one now before us, but <abbr

    “<i>The design of this treatise is to explain all that is commonly included in a First Part of Algebra. In the arrangement of the chapters, I have followed the advice of experienced teachers. I have carefully abstained from making extracts from books in common use. The only work to which I am indebted for any material assistance is the Algebra of the late Dean Peacock, which I took as the model for the commencement of my treatise. The examples, progressive and easy, have been selected from university and college examination papers, and from Old English, French, and German works.</i>”—<span
      class="smcap">From the Preface.</span></p>
  <p class="txt_sm">
    “<i>It is evident that <abbr title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> Hamblin Smith is a teacher, and has written to meet the special wants of students. He does not carry the student out of his depth by sudden plunges, but leads him gradually onward, never beyond his depth from any desire to hurry forward. The examples appear to be particularly well arranged, so as to afford a means of steady progress. With such books the judicious teacher will have abundant supply of examples and problems for those who need to have each step ensured by familiarity, and he will be able to allow the more rapid learner to travel onward with ease and swiftness. We can confidently recommend <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>
    Hamblin Smith’s books. Candidates preparing for Civil Service examinations under the new system of open competition will find these works to be of great value.</i>”—<span
